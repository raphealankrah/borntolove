                Our current focus is simple but powerful: Spreading the gospel of Jesus by serving our community through feeding the homeless and hungry, one meal at a time, with dignity, compassion, and hope.
                Inspired by the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, we believe that everyone deserves to be seen, valued, and  cared for.
                We don&apos;t just hand out food; we offer connection, prayer, and a reminder that no one is forgotten. <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Whether it&apos;s through a warm meal, a kind conversation, or a helping hand, we are committed to being the hands and feet of Jesus to those who need it most. As we grow, our vision remains clearâ€”to build a community where compassion leads, and no one is left behind.
